# Project Glossary

***
#### ***ESC*** - Electronic Speed Controller
>An electronic device that regulates the speed, direction, and sometimes braking of an electric motor. It is most 
> commonly used to drive three-phase brushless DC (BLDC) motors, which are widely used in applications such as drones, 
> unmanned vehicles, electric propulsion systems, and robotics.

#### ***IDE*** - Integrated Development Environment
>  A software application that provides programmers with a set of tools in one place to write, edit, debug, and manage 
> code efficiently. It usually includes a source code editor, a compiler or interpreter, a debugger, and often features 
> like version control integration and project management.

#### ***LTS*** - Long-Term Support
> A stability-focused release that gets security and critical bug fixes (no new features) for an extended period.

#### ***Machine*** - Computing System
> A term commonly used to refer to a **computer or computing system**, often in contexts where its role, function, or
> relationship to other systems is more important than its physical form. The word emphasizes the computer as a unit of
> execution rather than as a personal device.
>
> **Common Uses:**  
> • **Local Machine** – the computer a user is directly working on.  
> • **Remote Machine** – a computer accessed over a network (e.g., via SSH).  
> • **Virtual Machine (VM)** – a software-emulated computer that runs inside another system.  
> • **Development Machine (Dev Machine)** – the computer where code is written, tested, and compiled.  
> • **Host Machine** – the system that provides resources or runs software for another system (often contrasted with a
>   *target machine*).  
> • **Target Machine** – the hardware or system where the final application is deployed and executed.
>
> **Notes:**  
> • In technical writing, “machine” is preferred when distinguishing multiple computers or roles in a workflow.  
> • In everyday use, “computer” or “PC” is more common.


#### ***MOB*** - Man Overboard
> A maritime emergency situation in which a person has fallen off a vessel into the water. It requires an immediate 
> response to locate and recover the individual before they are injured, lost, or exposed to dangerous environmental 
> conditions.


#### ***SAR*** - Search and Rescue
> The coordinated efforts and operations conducted to locate, assist, and recover individuals who are in distress or 
> imminent danger, typically in remote or hazardous environments. In the maritime context, SAR missions involve 
> responding to incidents such as man overboard (MOB), capsized vessels, or missing persons at sea.
  

#### ***USV*** - Unmanned Surface Vessel
>  A surface vessel that operates without a crew onboard. It can be remotely operated, autonomously controlled, or a 
> combination of both. USVs are typically equipped with sensors, navigation systems, and communication technologies 
> that allow them to perform missions without direct human intervention.
