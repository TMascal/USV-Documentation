#### ***ESC*** - Electronic Speed Controller
>An electronic device that regulates the speed, direction, and sometimes braking of an electric motor. It is most 
> commonly used to drive three-phase brushless DC (BLDC) motors, which are widely used in applications such as drones, 
> unmanned vehicles, electric propulsion systems, and robotics.

#### ***MOB*** - Man Overboard
> A maritime emergency situation in which a person has fallen off a vessel into the water. It requires an immediate 
> response to locate and recover the individual before they are injured, lost, or exposed to dangerous environmental 
> conditions.


#### ***SAR*** - Search and Rescue
> The coordinated efforts and operations conducted to locate, assist, and recover individuals who are in distress or 
> imminent danger, typically in remote or hazardous environments. In the maritime context, SAR missions involve 
> responding to incidents such as man overboard (MOB), capsized vessels, or missing persons at sea.
  

#### ***USV*** - Unmanned Surface Vessel
>  A surface vessel that operates without a crew onboard. It can be remotely operated, autonomously controlled, or a 
> combination of both. USVs are typically equipped with sensors, navigation systems, and communication technologies 
> that allow them to perform missions without direct human intervention.
