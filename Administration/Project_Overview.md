# MOB SAR Senior Design Project
***
### Summary
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) proposes a three-year capstone program to enhance undergraduate training in 
Navy-relevant maritime robotic systems. The initiative aims to address the Department of the Navy's (DON) need for 
skilled personnel in robotic and uncrewed systems by integrating targeted, team-based capstone projects into ERAU’s 
existing Mechanical Engineering Robotic Systems curriculum. 

### Three Phase Project

| Year                 | Work                                                                                                              |
|:---------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Year 1 (Base Effort) | Develop core autonomy capabilities for single-domain man overboard (MOB) search and rescue (SAR) missions.        |
| Year 2 (Optional)    | Refine and expand these capabilities, introducing cooperative autonomy.                                           |
| Year 3 (Optional)    | Integrate single- and multi-domain autonomy into a cohesive system for MOB SAR missions.                          |
