# How to Define System Requirements
***

>Defining System Requirements is among the most critical steps of the engineering design process.

### The Method

The hardest part of tracking System Requirements is how the team actually does it. There are specialized tools 
that make the proces easier the further into the project you get, but in the initial stages, the zeal to use these tools 
can often discourage the use of them. When starting out, I would recommend sticking to something that all the team 
members are able to understand and contribute to. Whether it is simple pen and paper or a Google sheets document.

### What to in the MetaData

|      Attribute      |           Example           |                                                          Purpose                                                           |
|:-------------------:|:---------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   Requirement ID    |         SYS-PWR-001         | Serves as a distinct identifying label that can be searched and linked to other requirements and tests. *Can Never Change* | 
|        Title        | Power System Output Voltage |                      Serves as a Human Readable Title that is able to change as requirements develop.                      |
| Validation Test ID  |          T-PWR_001          |                                     Assigned Requirement Validation Test Documentation                                     | 

#### Requirement Breakdown ID
> Example - SYS-PWR-001
> * SYS - System Requirement
> * PWR - Power System
> * 001 - The first requirement created under the SYS-PWR Prefix
