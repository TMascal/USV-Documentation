# Guide to O-Rings, Gaskets, and Other Seals

**Context:**  
This document provides guidance on how to implement O-rings and other sealing solutions (such as gaskets, lip seals, and face seals) into Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) designs.

## Purpose Statement

The purpose of this guide is to assist USV designers, engineers, and systems integrators in selecting, specifying, and applying sealing components—especially O-rings, gaskets, and related seals—to ensure water-tight, pressure-tight, corrosion-resistant, and durable interfaces. The document provides best practices, material considerations, installation techniques, common failure modes, and design tips to enhance seal performance, reliability, and maintainability in marine environments.

---

## 4. Installation Guidelines and Hardware Interfaces

*(Surface finish, grooves, gland design, compression, torquing, lubrication, alignment issues, tool use.)*

---

## 5. Failure Modes and Diagnostics

*(Common issues like extrusion, abrasion, chemical attack, compression set, thermal aging, swelling; how to detect and prevent.)*

---

## 6. Design Best Practices for USVs

*(Special considerations for marine operations: biofouling, pressure variation, salt corrosion, vibration, dynamic interfaces.)*

---

## 7. Maintenance, Inspection, and Replacement Strategies

*(Inspection intervals, signs of seal degradation, replacement procedures, spare parts management.)*
