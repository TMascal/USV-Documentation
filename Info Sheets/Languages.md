# Languages Guide
***
Programming has become essential to nearly every aspect of the engineering world. It is no longer the exclusive domain
of Software Engineers and Computer Scientists. Mechanical Engineers, especially those working in the field of robotics 
will need to have at least a basic, or even advanced level of understanding of programming and software.

## C++
C++ (Pronounced See-Plus-Plus), or abbreviated cpp, is a compiled programming language built on top of the ubiquitous
[C programming language](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_intro.php). It is an object orientated programming language that 
is used as a "System Language".

> A language described as a *System Language* is shorthand for what the language should be used for.

C++ is often used as a low level language, used to writing device drivers. C++ often able to execute faster than an equivalent program written in a language such as Python because it is *Compiled Before Runtime*. Meaning the human-readable and written "source code" is translated or "compiled" to machine code depending on the hardware that you will be using. Please refer to [the info sheet on computers](../Info Sheets/Computers.md)

## Python
Python is a "scripting language" and is often used to interface with high level systems. It is often favored in research 
and prototyping environments due to its huge capabilities and easy to learn syntax. It has dynamic typing and 
object-oriented structure. Most importantly Python is an *Interpreted Language" meaning the source code is translated 
into machine code during runtime. This often slows the execution of the software and requires careful attention when 
setting up the run environment of the program. For more information, please visit the [Python3 Online Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).
