The hardest part of contributing to the development of a new robotics project is figuring out how to setup your 
development environment. Choosing what OS, what libraries, how the workflow is supposed to work; all of these are 
important decisions that many people do not even think about when starting out. This beginning stage is often the 
hardest to get through. To aid you in the start-up process, I will be walking you through preparing your machines for 
development, both the Target Machine (The Robot) and your Development Machine (Your Laptop).
