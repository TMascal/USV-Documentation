# Quick Start Guide
***

The hardest part of contributing to the development of a new robotics project is figuring out how to setup your 
development environment. Choosing what OS, what libraries, how the workflow is supposed to work; all of these are 
important decisions that many people do not even think about when starting out. This beginning stage is often the 
hardest to get through. To aid you in the start-up process, I will be walking you through preparing your machines for 
development, both the Target Machine (The Robot) and your Development Machine (Your Laptop).

### Development Machine Setup
The development machine is where you will be working on the project. This is most often a personally owned laptop when 
working in Senior Design.

#### Recommended System Requirements

| Component               | Baseline recommendation                                                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CPU**                 | Multi-core (8+ cores) with a clock of at least **3.2 GHz**                                  |
| **GPU**                 | Dedicated graphics with **≥ 4 GB VRAM**                                                     |
| **Memory (RAM)**        | **16 GB** minimum                                                                           |
| **Storage**             | **512 GB SATA SSD (non-NVMe)** minimum                                                      |
| **Ports (recommended)** | At least **2× USB-A**, **1–2× USB-C/Thunderbolt**, **HDMI**, **RJ-45 Ethernet**, SD/microSD |
| **OS**                  | Windows 11 Pro **and** Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 LTS (dual-boot or separate drive)                 |


#### OS Setup Options
As part of the development process, you will need to have access to a UNIX based operating system (OS). The reccomended 
OS for ROS2 Humble is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
