# Material Selection Considerations for Corrosion in Salt Water Environments

---

## Overview

When selecting materials for marine vessel construction, the primary concern is resisting degradation from electrochemical reactions driven by chloride ions, oxygen, and often microorganisms. Key trade-offs include balancing **corrosion resistance**, **mechanical strength**, **density/weight**, **fabrication/weldability**, and **cost**.

Some materials are chosen for structural strength (steel, aluminium), others for piping and seawater handling (copper-nickel, bronze), others for coatings or seals (epoxy, EPDM). Selecting the right material means balancing resistance, cost, and maintainability.

## Surface Treatments & Coatings

### Anodization
Aluminium alloys like 6061, 5083, and 5086 benefit from **anodization**, which builds a protective oxide film:
- Increases corrosion resistance.
- Provides better adhesion for paints.
- Improves wear resistance.
- Still vulnerable if mechanically damaged → combine with sealants or paint.

### Other Coatings
- **Epoxy/Polyurethane paints**: Universal for steel hulls.
- **Vinyl ester gelcoats**: Standard for fiberglass hulls.
- **Thermally sprayed aluminium/zinc**: Sacrificial coating for steels.

## Galvanic Compatibility Tip

- Pair metals close on the galvanic series.
- Electrically isolate dissimilar metals.
- Use sacrificial anodes (zinc, aluminium, magnesium).
- Apply protective coatings where needed.
